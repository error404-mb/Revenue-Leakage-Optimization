# Optimizing Revenue Leakage and Profitability in Hospitality Sector
- *Collaborative Team Project – Summer Projects, IIT Guwahati*

# Team Members
- Malobika Barma
- Jagriti

# Project Objective
- This project analyzes hotel performance to uncover revenue leakage by identifying cancellations, inefficiencies, and loss patterns. Using simulated hospitality datasets, it explores key KPIs like Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and WoW trends, supported by an interactive Power BI dashboard.

# Dataset
We were provided 5 datasets, that simulates a real hotel database:
- fact_bookings.csv : Booking dates, stay duration, room types
- dim_hotel.csv : about hotels (ID, location, type, etc.)
- dim_rooms.csv : Room information (room type, size, category)
- dim_date.csv : Cancellation reasons and amounts lost
- fact_aggregated_booking.csv : Daily room and non-room revenue

# Tools and Technologies used
- Python – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – EDA and visualization
- Power BI – Dashboard creation and KPI tracking

# Project Overview
We collaboratively analyzed given datasets to track key metrics and uncover hidden revenue leakage.
Here is a brief overview that we did -

- we performed EDA to identify trends across time, booking channels, and room categories.
- Then, we do Feature engineering and calculation of important KPIs such as ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and Week-over-Week changes
- Find out reason of revenue leakage that mainly includes cancellations, underutilized room categories, inefficient pricing, low visibility of booking patterns, and unoptimized service utilization.
- Then finally we Built an interactive dashboard to visualize insights dynamically, enabling data-driven decisions and strategic optimization.
